# Haskell For Marlowe Bootcamp

This Bootcamp is designed to teach students Haskell from zero to everything needed to work with Marlowe. It also serves as a stepping stone for the "Haskell for Plutus" Bootcamp that we'll release after this one.

**The course itself doesn't contain content specific to Marlowe. So, if you want to learn Haskell for other purposes, you can use this course too!** ðŸ˜ƒ

## To do the homework

1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) account.
3. Click this button to create a remote dev environment: [![Visual Studio Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visual%20Studio%20Code-0078d7.svg?style=flat&logo=visual-studio-code&logoColor=white)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/rober-m/haskell-bootcamp)
4. Select the `code/HomeworkXX` folder with the homework you want to complete.
5. Follow the instructions inside the app/Main.hs file.

## What we'll cover

**This is a tentative outline. Changes can (and will) be made as we advance with the course and gather feedback from students.**
