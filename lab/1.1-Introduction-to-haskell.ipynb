    "###  Funcitonal programming languages\n",
    "Haskell is a purely functional programming language. In functional programming languages, **programs are constructed by applying and composing functions**. Function definitions are **trees of expressions that map values to other values rather than a sequence of imperative statements** like in imperative languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function composition\n",
    "\n",
    "Function composition is the act of **combining simple functions into more complicated ones**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the usual composition of functions in mathematics, the **result of each function is passed as the argument of the next**, and the result of the last one is the result of the whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we have two functions $f$ and $g$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = f(x)$$\n",
    "$$z = g(y)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Composing them means we first compute $f(x)$ to get $y$, and then use $y$ as an argument to compute $g(y)$ to get $z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "On top of that, if we only care about the final result ($z$), we can skip naming the result of $f(x)$ as $y$ and just write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z = g(f(x))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**That's how we can create arbitrarly complex functions by composing single functions** For example, we could create a function that takes a CSV file and extracts a list of users from it, another one that takes a list of users and adds them to a database tagging them as new users, and one that takes a dababase with users and sends an email to all new users. We could create a single function that takes a CSV file and sends emails to all new users on that CSV file by composing those three functions."

    "\n",
    "In mathematics, the expression $y = x + 1$ means that the value of $y$ is a function that depends on $x$. For a specific $x$ (e.g., $3$), the value of $y$ will always be the same (e.g, $y = 3 + 1 = 4$). No matter if you're in Italy or Spain, if it's 1994 or 2022, or if you have other equations in the notebook. $y$ will care about the value of $x$ and nothing else.\n",
